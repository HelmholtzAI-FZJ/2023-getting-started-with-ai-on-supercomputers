### Course description: 
Fancy using High Performance Computing machines for AI? Fancy learning how to run your code one of Europe's fastest computers JUWELS Booster at FZJ?

In this workshop, we will guide you through the first steps of using the supercomputer machines for your own AI application. This workshop should be tailored to your needs - and our team will guide you through questions like:


- How do I get access to the machines? 
- How do I use the pre-installed, optimized software?
- How can I run my own code?
- How can I store data so I can access it fast in training?
- How can parallelize my training and use more than one GPU?

In this workshop, we will try to get your code and your workflow running and would like to make the start on a supercomputer as smooth as possible. After this course, you are not only ready to use not only HAICORE but you have made your first step into unlocking compute resources even on the largest scale with a compute time  application at the Gauss Supercomputing Center.

This workshop will be held in a small group size with enough space to address your questions. Please give us an indication on what topics you are interested in and we will try to adjust.

This course will be repeated in May, September and November. Exact dates are not yet available.

### How to generate HTML

- You need `pandoc`. On a mac, use `brew install pandoc`.
- After that, just call `make` to create the self-contained HTML files.

## Certificate
Turns out indico does not have a certificate system - but one can use the badges as a template - and add an image to the back of it. I added the "participation certificate" word document here as a template for that. I am doing this with text so I can use better typography than allowed by indico. Generate a large bitmap from that page and simply add to further courses.
