## Let's talk about DATA

- Some general considerations one should have in mind

---

--- 

## I/O is separate and shared

#### All compute nodes of all supercomputers see the same files

- Performance tradeoff between shared acessibility and speed
- It's simple to load data fast to 1 or 2 gpus. But to 100? 1000? 10000?

### Jülich Supercomputers

- Our I/O server is almost a supercomputer by itself

## Where do I keep my files?

- **`$PROJECT_projectname`** for code
    - Most of your work should stay here
- **`$DATA_projectname`** for big data(*)
    - Permanent location for big datasets
- **`$SCRATCH_projectname`** for temporary files (fast, but not permanent)
    - Files are deleted after 90 days untouched

---

## Data services

- JSC provides different data services
- Data projects give massive amounts of storage
- We use it for ML datasets. Join the project at **[Judoor](https://judoor.fz-juelich.de/projects/join/datasets)**
- After being approved, connect to the supercomputer and try it:
- ```bash
cd $DATA_datasets
```

---

## Data Staging

- [LARGEDATA filesystem](https://apps.fz-juelich.de/jsc/hps/juwels/filesystems.html) is not accessible by compute nodes
    - Copy files to an accessible filesystem BEFORE working
- Imagenet-21K copy alone takes 21+ minutes to $SCRATCH
    - We already copied it to $SCRATCH for you

## Data loading

--- 

## Strategies

- We have CPUs and lots of memory - let's use them
    - multitask training and data loading for the next batch
    - `/dev/shm` is a filesystem on ram - ultra fast ⚡️
- Use big files made for parallel computing
    - HDF5, Zarr, mmap() in a parallel fs, LMDB
- Use specialized data loading libraries
    - FFCV, DALI, Apache Arrow
- Compression sush as squashfs 
    - data transfer can be slower than decompression (must be checked case by case)
    - Beneficial in cases where numerous small files are at hand.

## Libraries

- Apache Arrow [https://arrow.apache.org/](https://arrow.apache.org/)
- FFCV [https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv](https://github.com/libffcv/ffcv) and [FFCV for PyTorch-Lightning](https://github.com/SerezD/ffcv_pytorch_lightning)
- Nvidia's DALI [https://developer.nvidia.com/dali](https://developer.nvidia.com/dali)
