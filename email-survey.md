Hello everyone! 

First of all, I would like to thank each and every one of you for the attendance to this course. 
We tried a number of new things, and I hope the course was easy enough to follow, while
being difficult enough to bring you new questions! 🙇‍♂️

There is plenty of compute hours on the training2402 project for you to play around with 
the code we provided, and to hopefully integrate some of what you learned on your own 
codes! Let's make those GPUs scream! 😱

We were asked for certificates for the course. Don’t worry, we will prepare them. Meanwhile, 
it would be very nice if you would give us some feedback, here: http://go.fzj.de/bringing-dl-workloads-to-jsc-survey

Again, thanks for your time!

Alexandre and Sabrina
